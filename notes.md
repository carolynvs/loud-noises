# Managing Da Noise

## Tell certain workspaces to listen for a named trigger

```
/create-trigger vacation = vacay (ðŸŒ´) DND

/create-global-trigger lunch = brb eating lunch (ðŸŒ¯) for 1h

/create-global-trigger sick = out sick (ðŸ¤’) DND

/create-trigger off-work = DND

/create-global-trigger busy = (ðŸ˜±)
```

## Clear your status

These are built-in so that you don't need to make a trigger

```
/clear-status
/clear-global-status
```

## Manual trigger

```
/trigger vacation for 1w
/trigger lunch
/trigger sick for 3d
```

## Schedule triggers

```
/schedule-trigger off-work MTuWTh 5pm until tomorrow
/schedule-trigger off-work F 5pm for 2d
```

## Show me my triggers

```
/list-triggers
/list-global-triggers
```
