Hi, my name is Carolyn and I am in too many Slack teams. Over 13 and counting!
üòÖ Although I only log into about 7 every day, that's only because Slack at that
scale just doesn't work well for me. 

<p align="center"><strong>I have Slack Overload.</strong></p>

The Kubernetes Slack is partly what motivated me to create this app. I am in
some SIG channels for work and have to pay attention to them for my job. I
really don't want to be answering questions and having them disturb my Sunday
mornings because... it's work. Other channels I am in just for fun, and I'm
always up for DM's from my friends in the community. 

The tools to control when Slack beeps at me just weren't cutting it: manually
muting/unmuting individual channels, logging in/out over the weekend. Try
managing that for over a dozen Slack teams. üò± Often I would fallback to the
nuclear option of setting my computer on Do Not Disturb instead.

Unfortunately Slack doesn't seem to understand my work schedule either. Which is
a bit odd since it is weekdays from 9am-5pm. I can schedule Do Not Disturb for
nights, but when my coworkers chat on the weekends... I get notified. Since I am
on a globally distributed team and some coworkers are one day ahead of me, my
Sunday is interrupted pretty much every. single. week. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

To top it off, with any channel it just takes one stressful day and too many gif
happy people for me to mute it, forget for months that it was muted, and then
feel left out

I love Slack. Slack is what makes my world possible. But I really need a big
button to shut Slack up sometimes. All of them. üòâ
