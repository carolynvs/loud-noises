description: How to make Slack shut up as quickly as possible

Now that you have Slack Overload enabled on one of your teams, what next? Open
up your Slack client and follow along...

## Define a status trigger

Triggers let you save a status change so you can quickly change your status
later. 

Let's define a trigger named "lunch" that will set your status to "brb omnomnom"
with the burrito ðŸŒ¯ emoji for one hour.

```
/create-trigger lunch = brb omnomnom (ðŸŒ¯) for 1h
```

## List your saved triggers

Remind yourself which triggers you have set up:

```
/list-triggers
```

## Trigger the status change

Ok, time for lunch!

```
/trigger lunch
```

## Clear your status

Sadly you got back from lunch early, and want the world to know.

```
/clear-status
```
