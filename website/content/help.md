Slack Overload is a **free** open-source free app. I appreciate knowing when it
is not working, or when the documentation isn't clear so that I can address it.
However, it is not officially supported.

When things go sideways, the best way to get help is to check if a similar
issue already exists, and if not [create an issue][issue].
